Instead of running, you try to wait it out, but the footsteps only get closer.
You try to separate yourself from the sounds, without turning around. Instead, you get stuck in a corner.
Without kicking it off, you try to walk away. This only makes the grip tighter.
You keep the doll at a distance, but every time you turn away and look back the doll is closer than before.
You don't look away, but he immediately moves to attack you.
You turn around to look at the picture and a figure is headed toward you.
The figure in the mirror begins laughing and coming closer than before.
You decide to back away from the door, which only allows a figure to walk right through and up to you.
You stay in the room, only a voice to begin taunting you from the corner.
You leave the flickering lights, only for them to catch on fire.
You leave the room as quickly as you can to stop feeling anxious, only for the feeling to become overpowering.
You leave the clock alone, only for it to spot suddenly, at the same time a chill passes through you.
Trying to walk away, the figure only stays right on your heels.
You stay in the room, but the screams only get closer.
Trying to tune out the crying baby, a creepy baby doll is thrown in front of you as the crying gets louder.
