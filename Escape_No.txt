You decide to wait it out, and eventually the sounds disappear.
Without turning around, you walk away as the footsteps disappear.
You freeze, but stand still long enough for the figure to let go of your leg.
You leave the doll in the corner, making sure to keep an eye on it.
Staring into the figures eyes, it eventually backs farther into the shadows.
Instead of looking at the picture, you hope that whatever knocked it over is long gone.
You keep eye contact through the mirror, only for the figure to disappear before your eyes.
You leave the door cracked, only to see a figure walk past the room you are in.
You wait for the shaking to stop, realizing the actions were harmless.
After a few seconds, the flickering suddenly stops.
You begin to panic and try to get out of the room you are in, only for the feeling to immediately pass.
The clock eventually stops spinning, leaving you with the wrong time.
You pause when you feel breath, but it eventually goes away.
Instead of following the screeching, you decide to wait for it to stop, which it eventually does.
The baby suddenly stops screaming, leaving you with an unsettling silence.
